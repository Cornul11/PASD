The Ferry Service wishes to automate the administration of the ticket reservations and of some of its other activities. Also, they wish that all the information about their assets should be stored in the system at all times so as to manage them easier. This report presents an outline of (a first version of) the envisaged information system, including its scope. That scope is derived from the given case description (see Appendix 1). The details of the information to be managed can be found in Section 7 (Data Model).

The report also contains an inventory of the roles involved in system, be it directly (actors) or indirectly (stakeholders); see Section 4. Moreover, the report mentions the currently envisaged user wishes the system should be able to fulfil (Section 5). Some of those user wishes are already worked out in detail in this report (in Section 6).
