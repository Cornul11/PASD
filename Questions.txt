- can a ticket be cancelled?
- is the car or truck reservation done separately of the passenger ticket?
- every commuter must have their own ticket or you can add multiple commuters on the same ticket (with extra cost obviously)?
- in the case information document, it is said that passengers can buy a ticket, thus there is no mention about the reservation of one. So the question is, can normal tickets also be reserved or they can only be bought straight away?
